# How to Access the ZJUGaze Dataset

Due to the strict requirements of our IRB, the dataset must remain on a local computer and cannot be accessed over the network. As a result, we offer remote desktop access through the Sunlogin software.

# Quick Start Guide

  1. Download and Install Sunlogin
     
  Download the Sunlogin software from **[here](https://sunlogin.oray.com/download)** and install it on your computer.
  
  2. Send an Access Request
     
  Email an access request, including your preferred access time, to **zhiguo@zju.edu.cn**.
  
  3. Receive Access Credentials
     
  We will respond to your request with a Sunlogin PartnerID and password, which you can use to access our desktop remotely.
  
  4. Access Guidelines
     
  You will have up to one hour of access to the dataset. During this time, you are not allowed to upload or transfer the dataset.
  
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
